            <p>The Pi-lot is a small communication device designed for messages between a central computer 
                and a remote raspberry pi-based device (the PI-lot). The raspberry-pi runs a flask app that is then 
                accessed by the central computer, and stores all messages sent out or recieved in a database.
                Messages from the central computer are sent via the flask app, at which the point the PI-lot 
                is prompted for a response.</p>
            <p>To properly use the Pi-lot, it will need to be attached to a computer or monitor of some sort 
                so that the flask app can be run via the command line. </p>

            <h3>PI-lot User Guide: </h3>
            <ol>

                <li>Open the send message page to send a message via the central computer</li>
                <li>View the messgage on your PI-lot
                    <ul>
                        <li>Right button: Scroll right</li>
                        <li>Left button: Scroll left</li>
                        <li>Down: Clear the message from display</li>
                        <li>Select: Play message out loud</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Choose whether or not to reply to the message</li>
                <li>If you choose to reply, type your message the press the down button to review and send.</li>
                <li>Pay attention to the notification received on the flask app. It will tell you
                    whether you have a new message (in the received messages page). Do not send 
                    another message until your first message is received.
                </li>

            <h3>Parts Overview</h3>

            <h4>Keyboard</h4>
            <p>Craft your message using the buttons on the keyboard, and press the enter button to send it</p>

            <h4>Audio</h4>
            <p>Plug headphones or a speaker into the audio jack to hear your message read aloud to you. This works
                for recently received messages as well as your reply, and is especially useful for longer messages.
            </p>

            <h4>Buttons</h4>
            <h5>Right/Left:</h5>
            <p>The left and right directional buttons scroll the message across the screen, which is particularly useful when messages
            exceed the 16 character limit of the screen. Longer messages are more difficult to view, as more scrolling is required. 
            Pi-lot prioritizes concise, and to the point messages above all else.</p>

            <h5>Down:</h5>
            <p>The down directional button allows the user to clear the display from any old messages. 
            This function allows for messages to remain private. Once you are done reading your message, clear the display to ensure
            the next messages are able to be shown.</p>

            <h5>Select:</h5>
            <p>When headphones or a speaker are connected to the audio jack included in the PI-lot, the user will be able to hear the messages
                when they are received. In order to access this feature, all you have to do is press the Select button present on the Pi-lot. 
                The Select button is located to the immediate left of the directional buttons, and will read messages aloud to the user when
                pressed.</p>
